Mokken Scale Analysis in R
}
\description{
Mokken scale analysis (Mokken, 1971; Sijtsma and Molenaar, 2002) is a scaling procedure 
for both dichotomous and polytomous items.
It consists of an item selection algorithm to partition a set of items into Mokken scales
 and several methods to check the assumptions of two nonparametric item response theory
models: the monotone homogeneity model and the double monotonicity model.
The output of this R-package resembles the output of the stand-alone program MSP (Molenaar and Sijtsma, 2000).

The package contains principal functions for Mokken scale analysis.

The package contains the following data sets
\tabular{ll}{
\code{\link{acl}}                \tab  Scores on a personality checklist. \cr
\code{\link{cavalini}}           \tab  Scores on an inventory on industrial malodor \cr
\code{\link{transreas}}          \tab  Scores on a transitive reasoning test \cr
}

A guide for Mokken scale analysis in R for people who do not know R (Van der Ark, 2010)  is available as a vignette from \url{http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mokken/vignettes/mokken.pdf}.

Version 0 was introduced in Van der Ark (2007). It included the functions
\tabular{ll}{
\code{\link{coefH}}              \tab Scalability coefficients \cr
\code{\link{coefZ}}              \tab Test statistics for scalability coefficients \cr
\code{\link{check.monotonicity}} \tab Investigate monotonicity assumptions \cr
\code{\link{check.restscore}}    \tab Investigate nonintersection assumption using Method Restscore \cr
\code{\link{check.pmatrix}}      \tab Investigate nonintersection assumption using Method Pmatrix \cr
\code{\link{search.normal}}      \tab Mokken's automated item selection algorithm \cr
}

The following major modifications have been made.
\tabular{ll}{
\code{\link{aisp}}               \tab  More general automated item selection algorithm. \cr
                                 \tab  Function \code{search} has become obsolete (Version 2.0)\cr
\code{\link{check.reliability}}  \tab  Compute reliability coefficients (Version 2.0)\cr
\code{\link{check.iio}}          \tab  Investigate invariant item orderings (Version 2.4) \cr
\code{\link{coefH}}              \tab  Standard errors for scalability coefficients included (Version 2.6)\cr
}

All updates until version 2.7 are described in Van der Ark (in press). The following modifications have been made in Version 2.7 in comparison to previous versions.
\tabular{ll}{
\code{\link{check.errors}}       \tab  Inclusion new function to compute weighted Guttman errors for each person. \cr
\code{\link{check.iio}}          \tab  \code{plot} has been added. \cr
\code{\link{check.monotonicity}} \tab  Computation of number of active pairs for dichotomous items has been corrected. \cr
\code{\link{check.pmatrix}}      \tab  Summary of the results has been corrected. \cr
\code{\link{check.restscore}}    \tab  Code pertaining to IIO has been deleted. The procedure is now equivalent to MSP. \cr
\code{\link{coefH}}              \tab  Option included to compare scalability coefficients across groups\cr
}

The following modifications have been made in Version 2.7.1 in comparison to previous versions.
\tabular{ll}{
\code{\link{mokken}}             \tab  Some legal issues \cr
}

The following modifications have been made in Version 2.7.2 in comparison to previous versions.
\tabular{ll}{
\code{\link{check.iio}}          \tab  Violations of IIO for dichotomous items are now tested using a z-test rather than a t-test. \cr
